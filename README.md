### What is the Game About?
For some of us, exercise and fitness comes naturally. But the rest of
us need some coaxing. This game was created for us to "Exercise by
Accident", to help us get a workout at home. 

With Juice It, you can get a surprising amount of exercise "by
accident", when there are many diverse and exciting things
to do to help you get carried away in sweat. 

Juice It is a VR game that blends psychomotor coordination and
cognitive ability to create an immersive fitness experience that is
engaging by transforming your world into the battleground that
is the Fruit Shop.

The game aims to help players simultaneously
get a good workout and practice test their memory. Juice It exercises
both the body and the mind, with a game objective for the player to complete as
many recipes, as quickly and as accurately as possible, as part of our vision for 
players to "Exercise by Accident".
